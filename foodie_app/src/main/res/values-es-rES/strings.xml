        <string-array name="food_info">
        <item>The kids will come running when you serve-up this lightened version of a perennial favorite.
            Ground turkey or chicken replaces the usual ground beef, and a fresh cucumber onion relish tops
            it all off!</item>
            <item>Adult and kid friendly, this fun pasta dish boasts loads of roasted salmon, fresh spring peas,
            and oodles of flavorful dill. And any leftovers (if there are any!) make for a delicious lunch.</item>
            <item>Looking for a meal that\'s both easy and healthy? You\'ve found it in this option with Brussels
            sprouts and apple.</item>
            <item>Made with cucumbers and salmon, this salad is as refreshing as it is easy to put together.
            Add the toasted bread of your choice for a satisfying crunch.</item>
            <item>Your summer dinners can be a breeze too. Either fire up the grill or use a grill plate to
            create this warm-weather dish.</item>
            <item>Your whole family will fall in love with these crispy chicken thighs (emphasis on "crispy").
            Garlic and rosemary make them as aromatic as they are delicious.</item>
            <item>No matter what you\'re serving as the entr√©e, this salad will complement it wonderfully
            (or just top it with protein to be your main meal). It\'s filled with fresh vegetables, herbs, and a homemade dressing.</item>
            <item>You and your significant other can tag team making this meal. While one person cooks the beans on the cast iron skillet,
            someone else can char the hot dogs on an indoor or outdoor grill. After all, teamwork makes the dream work!</item>
